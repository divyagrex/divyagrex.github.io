                            In early 2012, a group of technology entrepreneurs, venture capital professionals, private investors, economists, former regulators, and engineers joined together to solve the biggest problem in Indian start-up ecosystem – a structured and easier/convenient way to raise capital from high quality approved angel investors.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Since then, we collaborated with entrepreneurs, banks, regulators and exchange ecosystem to create a new protocol to make this seamless.
                            <br/><br/>
                            After two and a half years of ground work, dozens of strategic partnerships, and regulatory discourses, GREX was born.
                            <br/><br/>
                            GREX (or GREX Alternative Investments Market) is an innovative financial services institution involved in building solutions that combine high finance with high technology.
                            <br/><br/>
                            GREX is building seamlessly integrated exchange-like platform and its associated ecosystem of participants to bring together private eligible Investors and high growth Unlisted Companies for information Exchange and Securities Transactions.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This will be a global first of its kind, seamless platform that will bring the similar experience of the regular Capital Market now available to private Investors to discover, enter and manage their investment interests in exciting Unlisted companies.
                            <br/><br/>
                            For the companies, this will bring forth a world of opportunities and possibilities. GREX will facilitate them to have a steady flow of need based access to capital. This will help them focus on building their companies and in turn generate superior overall value. Companies at GREX can therefore trigger multiple rounds of capital raising depending on their growth needs.
                            <br/><br/>
                            For this to work well for Companies, they will be required to be on the platform and share their regular details/updates with the community inside the platform. This information sharing forms the basic bed-rock of the Information Exchange at GREX. GREX will enable many 2nd and 3rd party integration to ensure this information is transformed into independent insights and analysis.
                            <br/><br/>
                            GREX therefore opens up a wide range of opportunities for many other enterprises to be created as associated participants in the larger ecosystem that works alongside the platform.
