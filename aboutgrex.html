            <h3>What is GREX?</h3>

            <p>
In early 2012, a group of technology entrepreneurs, venture capital professionals, private investors, economists, former regulators and engineers joined together to solve the biggest problem in the Indian start-up ecosystem – a structured, easy and convenient way to raise capital from high quality, approved angel investors.
</p>
<p>
We collaborated with entrepreneurs, banks, regulators and exchange ecosystem to create a new protocol to make this process seamless.
</p>
<p>
After two and a half years of ground work, dozens of strategic partnerships, and regulatory discourses, GREX was born.
</p>
<p>
GREX (or GREX Alternative Investments Market) is an innovative financial services institution involved in building solutions that combine high finance with high technology.
</p>
<p>
GREX is building a seamlessly integrated exchange-like platform and its associated ecosystem of participants, to bring together private eligible investors and high growth unlisted companies for information exchange and securities transactions.
</p>
<p>
This will be a global, first of its kind, seamless platform that will refresh the experience of the regular capital market as it is now available to private investors, so they can then discover, enter and manage their investment interests in exciting unlisted companies with high potential.
</p>
<p>
For the companies, this will bring forth a world of opportunities and possibilities. GREX will facilitate a steady flow of need based access to capital for them like never before. This will mean they can focus better on building their companies and in turn generate superior overall value. Companies at GREX can therefore trigger multiple rounds of capital raising, depending on their growth needs.
</p>
<p>
For this to work well for companies, they will be required to be on the platform and share their regular details/updates with the community inside the platform. This information sharing forms the basic bedrock of the information exchange at GREX. GREX will enable many 2nd and 3rd party integrations to ensure this information is translated into independent insights and analysis, thus offering more credibility to unlisted companies.
</p>
<p>
GREX therefore opens up a wide range of opportunities for many other enterprises to be created as associated participants in the larger ecosystem that works alongside the platform.

                            Manish built GREX because, he was gutted to see companies die because they couldn't run the process of fund raising when they could instead bring value to the world. He wanted to create a system where investors who wanted to contribute to emerging companies will get the best way to get involved, invest and grow together, with minimal stress.

            <h3>How Grex is Run?</h3>

            <p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>The modern business corporation emerged as the first institutional claimant of significant unregulated power since the nation state established its title in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

            </p>

            <p>We at GREX believe, and very strongly so, that good Corporate Governance establishes the strong foundations on which large enterprises can be built. We strongly believe that good Corporate Governance pays very rich dividends over a long term.</p>

            <p>Therefore we have been working on developing a Governance System for GREX that embodies some of the best global practices in Corporate Governance. Following are some of the first principles that we have been working on establishing :

            <ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Separation of Ownership (of company) and Market Operations</strong>
                    <br/>
                    At GREX we have a clear distinction between the Company Operations and the Market Operations. While the former is governed by the Board, the latter is governed by an independent Governing Council (formed out of eminent individuals from different backgrounds and expertise). The Executive Management works with both of them and supports both in achieving their objectives.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Mutual Independence of all functional bodies</strong>
                    <br/>
                    For each of the functional bodies to discharge of their responsibilities in due earnest, it was essential that they be free to function independently. The Board, Governing Council and the Executive Management at GREX work and function independently and this is being done seamlessly at GREX since its very inception..
                </li>

                <li>

                    <strong>Comprehensive Bye Laws for the Market</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The GREX Platform is governed according to the bye-laws of the Market. This bye-law is the accepted model that every participant on the platform will need to have basic adherence to thus forming the basis of a well governed, rule and process based framework for the Market.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Guiding principles to define whatever we do.</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The Operations at GREX are run through a declared set of Guiding Principles. GREX has adopted a simple but powerful Guiding Principle that defines some of the actions or inactions and even policy directions on how things work here.
                </li>

            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                While we want all our companies at GREX to follow high standards of corporate governance, it was imperative we take the lead in doing so ourselves. The above framework is a way of achieving the same. We pledge to be on the forefront of Corporate Governance and be willing to do more and change as per the needs of the times to ensure high standards of the same.
